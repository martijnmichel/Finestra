        <p>Sonid started out as a hobby project. I was working as a guitar teacher and tried to teach my students about music theory. There was no fun and easy way to do this.
          That's why I started to work on Sonid, an app to learn music theory. The building process was long and sometimes difficult. On the way, I learned a lot about structuring apps and bug-fixing.
          I also made a website, which is actually a beautiful database of music theory.</p>
        <p>Today Sonid is used by over 30.000 music students, and the app and websites are translated in four languages.</p>
